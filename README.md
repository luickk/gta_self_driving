GTA self driving Agent
===================

The goal is to program a self-driving agent, that is capable of driving a car in gtaIV.
Since the project aims on a approach which excludes every other data source except for the view of the driver the car is only ment to drive down a car way with no complex turning or overhaul maneuvers.

Demonstration video can be watched [here](media/demo.mp4)

----------

Realization
-------------

The Agent is programmed in python and trained with a [CNN](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/wide_and_deep) which is based on [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

	> - Clone Repository
	> - Install Dependencies

#### <i class="icon-camera"></i> Capture data

	To collect data use collect_data.py.
	Gta window has to be shrunk down to a resolution of 800x600
	and moved to the left upper corner.
	
	Set path variable to your prefered location.
	Files will be saved in approximately 300KB .npy files(uncompressed).
	
	To start collect_data.py several arguments can be used.
	> - -s can be a number to define starting step manualy or "forward" to 
	use existing files as step indicator.

#### <i class="icon-ccw"></i> Training

	To train your model use train.py.
	Set path variable to location where training data is saved.
	Name your model by setting MODEL_NAME variable to your most preferred name.
	
#### <i class="icon-right-big"></i> Testing

	To test your model use test_model.py.
	Choose your already trained model by setting MODEL_NAME variable to your best trained one.
	
	To test the agent the Gta window has to be shrunk down to a resolution of 800x600
	and moved to the left upper corner.
	
	Now, everything is ready to be tested.

#### <i class="icon-archive"></i> Prefabricated models

	Prefabricated models will be provided as far as I can produce them myself and 
	as far as they fit my own requirements.
